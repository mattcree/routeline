# ROUTELINE
This is the main repository for the Routeline project we're doing as part of the MSc Computer Science 2016/17 Software Engineering with Group Project module.

## Description

A a system for providing information about rail travel for the North Eastern Railway Division (NERD). The idea behind the application is to make life easier for travellers by allowing them to check their train information at kiosks in stations or online.

## Functionality
The system allows the user to do the following:
-	Create train lines.
-	Record all the train stations on a line, a minimum transfer time between trains at each station, and the journey time between stations.
-	Allow for addition and removal of new stations and connections
-	Provide an interface for the user to allow them to search for optimal routes between stations
-	Allow a route to be requested that must avoid, or has to include, a given station.
-	Allow a traveller to select a maximum number of train changes for a long trip.
-	Other extensions you may think are useful.
